# Open Skirmish
### Open Source Miniature Combat System
Open Skirmish is a miniature combat game system that combines the character-focused aspects of table-top role-playing
games with the skirmish feel of popular miniature combat games, with a web interface for creating characters, maps, and
scenarios.

## Everything is open-source.
Want to help build Open Skirmish?  Fork the game on github and make a pull request.
Want to make a module - be it a character template, a game scenario, or a whole world to play in? Do it! We'll include a
list of community made modules on the official page (when there's an official page).

## Use what you have, or what you build.
Inspired by games like Open Combat and Gaslands, Open Skirmish uses whatever you want it to use. Players can use
miniatures from existing games, rpg miniatures, transforming robot toys, little green army men, bottle caps, drink
coasters, polymer clay sculptures, kit-bashed toys, or anything else. All that's needed is to create the characters
using the Open Skirmish web interface point-buy character creation system (which does not, of course, exist yet), and
the sky's the limit.

## This thing is just starting out.
So far, this game is purely theoretical

## Isn't there a game called Open Combat?
Yep, and to keep this game original, I ([ingusmat[(https://github.com/ingusmat)) have never looked at it, and probably never will. I know it's there.
It's likely similar. I want us (the Open Skirmish Community) to build our own anyway.  That said, it's probably better
than what I'll come up with.

Check it out, I bet it's fun. I don't have the link.  You can google it.
