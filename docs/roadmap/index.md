#Mission Statement
_Initial version, created 2020-12-05_

## Start small, build up
In the beginning, this game should be super simple.  In addition, the core rules should REMAIN super simple, allowing
anyone to build more complex scenarios, character types, and so on as they please.
Think, could an average 12 year old play this game?

## Character based, infinite characters
The game should remain character based, like many popular miniature skirmish games, but unlike those, the player should
be able to create the characters themselves, like a role-playing game. In this light, creating characters should be
easy, and making new character types should keep game balance in mind.

## The game will remain open source
Anyone can build modules, expand or create new character types (called templates(?)), and create game scenarios. Focus
on building a community.

## Character creation should be non-complex, enjoyable, and use the webapp.
One of the most daunting and non-newbie-friendly parts of many role-playing games is character creation, which can
sometimes take upwards of an hour for some pencil and paper games. This is a perfect way to get people to not play your
game.
Let's keep character creation easy, template-based, and fun, using a web interface that can print out physical character
sheets or cards that are easy to read and easy to use.

## There will be a tabletop version and a web game version.  They will use the same rules.
Since we're using a web interface to create characters, let's take that one step further (a giant step, mind you) and
try to make a web version of the tabletop combat game using the same rules, character cards/sheets, and scenarios as the
tabletop game. Again, keep it simple.  The graphics need not be stunning. Let the game shine through the interface, not
vice versa.
The web game should be either top-down or isomorphic, and turn based, just like the tabletop version.

## The tabletop game will use whatever miniatures or toys or junk the players agree on.  
Open Skirmish has _no official game pieces_, including miniatures.
Players can use the rules for playing with anything from kit-bashed toys to 28mm miniatures to bottle caps.
The setting and scale of the game are likewise fluid. drink-coasters as giant robots in outer space? Fantastic. fully
sculpted polymer clay monsters ransacking feudal Japan?  Awesome.  Whatever you want, as long as all players playing a
scenario agree on the same scale -- or not! Giant insects versus HO scale infantry should still work, if the players
want.

## Because the game is about community, keep it respectful.
Any use of racist, homophobic or sexist language in Open Skirmish rules, modules, or scenarios is antithetical to
building a community, and expressly prohibited. Any pull requests containing such language or themes will be rejected.
Rules and official modules should use 'they/them' pronouns when referring to players, as alternating him and her is tedious, and picking one
is exclusionary. Just do it, it's just one more letter to type, and including everyone is worth that.

## Everything should be points-buy based.
If we do our job right, the game should be super-scalable. Everything from hitpoints to spells to weapons to infantry
counts should be on a points-buy basis, with games agreeing to each use a range of x to y points. For instance, Jim and
Maria are playing a 110 point giant robot game with the capture the flag scenario, and both their army lists should be
110 points plus or minus an agreed-on number of points. Frank's 108 point steampunk troopers list should be able to drop
into the game seamlessly.

## It should be fun to play and develop.
Otherwise, what's the point? Let's build this thing!
